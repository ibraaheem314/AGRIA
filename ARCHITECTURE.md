# AgriTech Platform Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AgriTech platform, which follows a feature-based organization pattern to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Overview

The application is structured around business domains (features) rather than technical concerns. This approach keeps related code together, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the application.

## Directory Structure

## Key Principles

### 1. Feature-First Organization

Code is organized by feature/domain rather than by type. This means that related code stays together regardless of whether it's a component, hook, or API function.

### 2. Encapsulation

Each feature is encapsulated with its own internal structure, promoting clear boundaries between different parts of the application.

### 3. Shared Code

Common functionality is placed in the `shared` directory, which contains components, hooks, and utilities used across multiple features.

### 4. Clear API Boundaries

Features expose a clear public API to other features. Internal implementations can change without affecting the rest of the application.

### 5. Independent Development

This architecture allows for independent development of features by different team members with minimal conflicts.

## Benefits

- **Improved discoverability**: It's easy to find all code related to a specific feature
- **Better maintainability**: Changes to a feature are localized
- **Enhanced code organization**: Related code stays together
- **Clearer boundaries**: Features have clearly defined responsibilities
- **Easier onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly
- **Better scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing ones

## Guidelines for Development

1. **New Features**: Create a new directory in `features/` for each new domain
2. **Shared Components**: Only move components to `shared/` when they're used by multiple features
3. **Feature Locality**: Keep feature-specific code within its feature directory
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Minimize dependencies between features
5. **Clear Exports**: Each feature should export only what other features need

By following these guidelines, we maintain a clean and maintainable architecture that scales well as the application grows.
